# Sinatra Portfolio Project - What's In My Fridge 

## Description
“What’s In My Fridge?” is a CRUD, MVC (Model View Controller) web application that allows users to create or add new grocery items to their fridge, read the grocery items in their fridge, update or edit the grocery items they own, and finally, delete or destroy any of the grocery items they own. With the use of forms new and altered data is persisted and retrieved to and from a database. User can login and out of the application, view other user’s fridges but NOT edit nor delete their items, and message other users via email. 

## Installation
Run bundle install to install the gems in Gemfile, then start the application via Shotgun by executing shotgun in your terminal.
